Introduction to Phishing
A phishing attack is a type of attack that usually aims to steal the user's personal information by tricking them into clicking on malicious links in emails or running malicious files on their computer.
Phishing attacks fall into the "Delivery" phase of the Cyber Kill Chain model created to analyze cyber-attacks. The 'delivery' phase is where the attacker transfers the pre-arranged malicious content to the victim systems/people.
